| Thailand            | Tourism is an economic contributor to the Kingdom of Thailand. Estimates , the equivalent of 9% to 17.7% of GDP.[1][2] When including indirect                         travel and tourism receipts, the 2014 total is estimated to be the equivalent of 19.3% (2.3 trillion baht) of Thailand. The actual                                     contribution of tourism to GDP is lower than these percentages because GDP is measured in value added not revenue. The valued added of the                             Thailand's tourism industry is not known. According to the secretary-general of the Office of the National Economic land Social Development                             Council in 2019, the government projects that the tourism sector will account for 30% of GDP by 2030.

The buildings lining the Bur Dubai side of the Creek provide the main flavor                           of the old city. Heritage Village is one of the few remaining parts of historical Dubai, containing preserved buildings. The adjoining Diving                           Village offers exhibits on pearl diving and fishing.
